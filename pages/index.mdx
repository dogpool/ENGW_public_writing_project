# The Housing Crisis

## Housing prices are through the roof!
# Whether we are buying or renting, any real estate property in big cities is just simply too expensive. 

My guess is that tomorrow, housing prices will increase even more. 
This blog will be allowing millenials to understand key terms about finance, real estate, and financial education.
This article does not give investment advice, it analyzes hypotethical financial decision moments and compares alternatives
to provide insight and promote discourse about the housing crisis.

Why are we having a housing crisis? Because our system has different, we are not capitalists anymore, nor are we socialists. 
We have become the neoliberalistic nation of America.
What is neoliberalism? you may ask.
Neoliberalsm is a socioeconomic construct in which people are only regarded as consumers of end goods and services.
This concept emerged when corporations reached multinational levels, allowing influence of brands to travel worldwide.
Neoliberalism means corporations, people, and society, will only judge a person based on what they choose to consume.

The unfortunate consequences of our this neoliberalistic system have become evident.
As millennials, we are and will be the poorest generation, out of all Americans generations.
And we will most likely be forced to do one of these two things.
Renting forever, or taking on massive and risky loans to become a homeowner.
Being forced to take on a life-changing amount of debt,
just so that we can own an average suburban house or 2 bedroom apartment downtown. 

Lets say we are taking the riskier route, taking out a loan to own property.
The first option would be to buy a house that is falling apart, do a bunch of repairs, and sell it for profit.
this is commonly known as the Fixer-Upper method of buying real estate property.

The second option, we can get a mortgage on a big multifamily condo, live in one of the units.
Do our best to actually receive profitable rent payments from other units, or enough to break-even on the mortgage payments. 

Both these instances ideal, assuming we know that we have to manage the renters, make the house look nice.
Basically taking on all the responsibilities of operating a rental household. 
It is a challenge for sure, and nothing is guaranteed.
We could easily and very quickly **default** or go bankrupt if no one wants to rent our units.

Our system used to revolve around the classic American Dream, any hard worker, 
regardless of where or who they came from, could save enough cash, open a business. 
If they worked hard enough they would become a millionaire and create wealth for themselves and their family. 
This American Dream-based construct system resulted in two things for the economy. 
First, a worker would work really hard and be productive so that could earn their pay. 
Secondly, they would put this money in a bank to save it and safely earn some interest. 

That old hard worker system, along with the good old American Dream, slowly changed around the 1970s
with the increased power of multinational corporations, and established its permenance in the 2000's with the internet. 

First, we have to be letting go of the idea of saving, the idea of putting money in a bank and saving it. 
Why? Because more than half us, the American millenial generation are living paycheck to paycheck. 
We are having 0$ remainder after paying all our necessary needs, and we might be borrowing money from our next paychecks,
getting us forever stuck in un-repayable cycles of debt.
Also, inflation has been rising, meaning everything will be getting more expensive. 
If the bank isn't providing enough interest on our savings to accomadate inflation,
our money will be losing value by staying in a banks saving account.

The new system affects the economy in only one way, endlessly fueling consumption so that corporations can thrive.
The only way we can keep up with housing prices is moving somewhere quiet or earning a lot more money every year. 
This is the new system, the new world order, and it's designed to making or breaking the average persons soul.
We are being pushed by this system, having to endlessly reach for better and more, until we no longer can, or willing.
