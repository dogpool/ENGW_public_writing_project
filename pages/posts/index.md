# The Housing Crisis

## Housing prices are through the roof!

### Whether we are buying or renting, any real estate property in big cities is just simply too expensive. 

My guess is that tomorrow, housing prices will increase even more.
 
This blog will be aiming to teach Millenials key terms about finance, real estate, and financial education.
This blog post does not give investment advice, it analyzes hypothetical financial decision moments and compares alternatives to provide insight and promote discourse about the housing crisis.

Why are we having a housing crisis? Because our system is changing.
We are not capitalists anymore, nor are we socialists. 
We are becoming the **neoliberalist** nation of America.
What is **neoliberalism?** you may be asking.
Neoliberalism is a socio-economic system, a way to rule and guide people 
in neoliberalism, people are only regarded as **consumers** of end goods and services.
This concept emerged when corporations reached multinational levels,
allowing the influence of brands to become incredibly powerful worldwide.
Neoliberalism means corporations, people, and society, 
will only judge a person based on what they choose to consume rather than who they really are.

The unfortunate consequences of this new system become more evident each day.
As millennials, we will be the poorest generation, out of all American generations.
And we will most likely be forced to do one of these two things.
Renting forever, or taking on massive and risky loans to become a homeowner.
Being forced to take on a life-changing amount of debt,
just so that we can own an average suburban house or 2 bedroom apartment downtown. 

Let's say we are taking the riskier route, taking out a loan to own property.
The first option would be:
-To buy a house that is falling apart, 
-Do a bunch of repairs out of pocket, you can deduct these **expenses** from your taxes too!
-The final step is selling the house for profit, living there, renting it out.
-What next? Move on to the next fixer upper, repeat the steps with a bigger house
-on to the next project with the profit or asset that you acquired from these steps.

this is commonly known as the Fixer-Upper method of buying real estate property.

The second option is:
- We can get a mortgage on a big multifamily condo, and live in one of the units.
- We can do our best to receive profitable rent payments from other units, or enough to break even on the mortgage payments. 

Both these instances are ideal if we are assuming:
- We are accepting that we have to manage the renters and make the house look nice for possible renters.
- Taking on all the responsibilities of operating a rental household _i.e._ regular landlord duties, maintenance, and collecting income. 
- We have a large risk of **defaulting**  if no one wants to rent our units.
It is a challenge for sure, and nothing is guaranteed.


Our system used to revolve around the classic American Dream, any hard worker, 
regardless of where or who they came from, could save enough cash, and open a business. 
If they worked hard enough they would become a millionaire and create wealth for themselves and their family. 
This American Dream-based construct system resulted in two things for the economy. 
First, a worker would work hard and be productive so that could earn their pay. 
Secondly, they would put this money in a bank to save it and safely earn some interest. 

That old hard worker system, along with the good old American Dream, slowly changed around the 1970s
with the increased power of multinational corporations, and established its permanence in the 2000s with the internet. 

First, we have to be letting go of the idea of saving, the idea of putting money in a bank and saving it. 
Why? Because more than half of the American millennial generation is living paycheck to paycheck. 
We are having 0$ remainder after paying all our necessary needs, and we might be borrowing money from our next paychecks,
getting us forever stuck in un-repayable cycles of debt.
Also, inflation has been rising, meaning everything will be getting more expensive. 
If the bank isn't providing enough interest on our savings to accommodate inflation,
our money will be losing value by staying in a bank's saving account.

The new system, neoliberalism, affects the economy in only one way, 
endlessly fueling consumption so that corporations can thrive.
The only way we can keep up with housing prices is by moving somewhere quiet
or earning a lot more money every year. 
This is the new system and it's designed on making or breaking the average person.
We are being pushed by this system, having to endlessly reach for better and more,
 until we no longer can, or are willing. 

Therefore it is necessary for us to be constantly learning
about what **not** to do with our hard-earned money. 
Always being vigilant for pyramid schemes, bad deals, and scammers
is the only way we can remain safe. The best way to remain vigilant is
1) Always do your own research
2) Don't take others' words for granted
3) Do not be close-minded to alternatives to bank savings
4) Hire a financial consultant to double-check everything
5) Make sure you do not make mistakes you can not afford (A consultant helps this as well)
6) Don't lose your motivation, it might be extremely difficult, but it's never impossible.
