# The Housing Crisis

## Housing prices are through the roof!
Whether you are buying or renting, any real estate property in big cities is just too expensive. 
The national average salary is nowhere near enough to sustain homeownership or even a decent rental lifestyle. 

The unfortunate consequence of our current system is evident.
As millennials, the poorest generation out of all Americans,
we will most likely be forced to do one of these two things.
Rent forever, or take on massive and risky loans to become a homeowner.
And you are forced to take on a life-changing amount of debt,
just so that you can own an average suburban house or 2 bedroom apartment downtown. 

Yes, you can get a mortgage on a big multifamily condo, live in one of the units,
gamble that you will make a profit, or enough to break even through renting out the other units to make your mortgage payments. 
This is ideal, assuming you know that you have to manage the renters, make the house look nice,
and do take on all the responsibilities of operating a rental household. It is a challenge for sure, and nothing is guaranteed.
You could easily and very quickly **default** or go bankrupt if no one wants to rent your units.

My guess is that tomorrow, housing prices will be even more expensive. 
Why? Because our system has changed, we are not capitalists anymore, nor are we socialists. 
We have become the neoliberal nation of America.

Our system used to revolve around the classic American Dream, any hard worker, 
regardless of where or who they came from, could save enough cash, open a business, 
become a millionaire and create wealth for themselves and their family. 
This American Dream-based construct system resulted in two things for the economy. 
First, a worker would work really hard and be productive so that could earn their pay. 
Secondly, they would put this money in a bank to save it and safely earn some interest. 

That system, along with the good old American Dream, slowly changed around the 2000s. 
First, let us forget about putting money in a bank and saving it. 
Because more than half of the American population live from paycheck to paycheck anyway. 
We have 0$ remainder after getting all our necessary needs, and we even borrow money from our next paychecks,
getting us stuck in un-repayable cycles of debt.

The new system affects the economy in one way, endlessly fueling consumption so that corporations can thrive.
The only way one can keep up with housing prices is to move somewhere quiet or earn a lot more money every year. 
This is the new system, the new world order, and it is designed to make or break the average person.
Now, we are pushed to endlessly reach for better and more. 

But wait, there's more to it... Let's just assume we get a huge promotion, or make a leap of faith and start our own e-commerce store. 
This will increase our income greatly, we will now have the ability to save. However, savings does not save our future anymore. 
By saving your money in the bak, you actually lose more money to inflation every year compared to what the bank gives you as interest. 

Is there a choice? Yes, investing in corporations, fueling the endless consumption,
 and almost double our income every year just to be able to afford what we afforded the previous year,
  and invest more, creating another endless cycle until we die..
